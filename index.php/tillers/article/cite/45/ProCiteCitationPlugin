N2  - In order to better understand the effects of moisture levels on the balance of C 3  and C 4  prairie plants, we planted two common, co-occurring grass species,  Elymus canadensis  (C 3 ) and  Andropogon gerardii  (C 4 ), in conditions of adequate water and water stress. In our final harvest, after 27d, water-stressed  E. canadensis  exhibited marginally increased stomatal density, reflecting an attempt to use water efficiently. There were no significant effects of drought on  A. gerardii ’s stomatal density, indicating that its water use efficiency is naturally high. Neither species’ root:shoot ratio, height, or biomass showed evidence of adaptation, however. The short time period available for drought-induced adaptation, as well as  A. gerardii ’s low germination rate and prolonged germination period, limited the conclusiveness of our results. Neither grass could adapt significantly to drought within a two-week stress period. But longer studies, on a variety of species, will uncover the differences between, and limits of, adaptations of C 3  and C 4  plants to water stress.
