N2  -  An understanding of topography is important to prairie management and ecological science. Spatial variability of resources impacts the success of plants in micro-environments. We studied the vigor of Big Bluestem and Indian Grass and the soil conditions on three hills in CERA prairies. Our results indicated increased vigor of Indian Grass with decreased elevation, as we hypothesized. The general absence of any relationship between elevation with soil conditions and plant vigor could have been a result of differences between the two plants, infrequent burnings, and irregularities. However, our results may also point toward the inherent complexity of resource variability in an ecosystem.
