%T  Soil Nitrogen Influences Early Root Allocation of  Lespedeza cuneata 
%K 
%X Invasive species such as  Lespedeza cuneata  are out-competing native prairie species and hindering prairie restoration efforts.  L. cuneata  has proved tolerant to “natural” forms of prairie management such as burning. Because fire reduces the amount of nitrogen in soil, the goal of our study was to test the effects of varying soil nitrogen levels on  L. cuneata . We measured stem height and root, shoot, and total biomass of  L. cuneata  for three weeks using four different soil nitrogen treatments. Our results show no significant differences in the height or total biomass of  L. cuneata  caused by the different nitrogen levels. Our data did, however, show a significantly higher percentage of root biomass in the treatment with no added nitrogen. This suggests that  L. cuneata  may allocate a higher percentage of energy to root biomass in soils with lower nitrogen content.
