N2  -  The control of invasive exotic species is one of the most important aspects of conservation (Cronk and Fuller, 1995). The tenacity of invasive plants allows them to disrupt the balance of existing ecosystems, altering growing conditions and eliminating other species (Cronk and Fuller, 1995). Species like  Lespedeza cuneata  are considered invasive because of their ability to dominate the other plants growing in the area (USDA).  L. cuneata  is present at CERA, and is treated with a combination of mowing, burning, and herbicide (Brown, personal communication). Because the application of herbicide is irregular, I decided to examine the effects of the other two treatments. Ideally,  L. cuneata  should decrease in density when burned or mowed. Unfortunately,  L. cuneata  tolerates both of these treatments well. When burned or mowed  L. cuneata  becomes more dense with new growth sprouting from the caudex (FEIS). The goal of this study is to clarify the effects of burning and mowing on  L. cuneata  and to determine the distribution patterns of the species. Once these facets of  L. cuneata  are understood, the species may be more effectively removed from the prairie.
