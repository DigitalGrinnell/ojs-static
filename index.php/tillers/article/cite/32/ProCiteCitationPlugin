N2  - As restoration of prairies has become popular, scientists have begun studying the natural occurrences, such as fire and grazing, on prairies and developing management plans that include these natural processes. However, some debate remains over which management techniques are the most productive. In order to understand the consequences of different management techniques for prairies, we examined the effects of spring burning and midsummer mowing on soil moisture, soil pH, and the percent of carbon and nitrogen in soil and in the roots and rhizomes of  Andropogon gerardii  (Big Bluestem) on experimental reconstructed prairie. While our results were not significant, past studies have shown these treatments to have significant effects on prairie ecosystems.
