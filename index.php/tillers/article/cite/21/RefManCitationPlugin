N2  - Invasive species have colonized native tallgrass prairies throughout the Mid-West since European settlement. One such species,  Lespedeza cuneata , has proven resistant to traditional management techniques such as fire and mowing.  L. cuneata  contains many traits that allow it to out compete native prairie species, however many questions still remain concerning factors in its early growth stages that allow for this domination. To answer some of these questions and continue the search for better management techniques, we measured dry root and shoot mass of  L. cuneata  and its native counter part  Lespedeza capitata  under high and low light for three weeks, thus isolating growth factors specific to the invasive species. Throughout the study significant factors affecting development changed weekly. Most interestingly, in the third week  L. cuneata  developed a larger root system, while maintaining shoot mass growth. This strong root system is a known factor in  L. cuneata ’s ability to out compete native prairie species. Light significantly affected growth for both species, but not differently, and therefore management techniques that manipulate light are not effective in controlling  L. cuneata . Further studies researching development of this root system and other traits that allow  L. cuneata  to dominate would be helpful in creating effective management techniques.
