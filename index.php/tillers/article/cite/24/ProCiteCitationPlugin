N2  - The soil of the prairie is never static; it is constantly affected by and affecting its inhabitant flora and fauna. Many interactions, including the scientific observer’s movement on the prairie, have an impact on the quality of the soil. This study examines the compaction that comes about from human foot traffic and the effect of soil compaction on the germination and vigor of  Andropogon gerardii . We predicted that repeated footfalls would significantly increase soil compaction in the field and that this greater soil density would retard germination and stunt growth. Our findings confirmed that foot traffic increased soil compaction and that greater soil compaction depressed the growth of  A. gerardii  but not its germination rate.
