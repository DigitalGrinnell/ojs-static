%T  Edaphic prairie arthropods, with the exception of Diptera, show no reaction to seasonal burns
%K 
%X Fire is an important tool used in prairie restoration because it stimulates grass and forb production as well as influencing the animal communities of the prairie. Prescribed burns have a varying effect on prairie communities depending on the season. Edaphic arthropods are an important part of the prairie ecosystem, aiding in the decomposition and distribution of organic matter, and it is important to understand how they are affected by seasonal burning. This study tested below-ground arthropod response to fall, spring and summer burns. Our results indicate that soil arthropods are not significantly affected by the season of burning with the exception of Dipterans, which were more abundant in summer burn plots than spring burn plots.
