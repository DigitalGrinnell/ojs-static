N2  - Nematodes have beneficial and detrimental effects in ecosystems, including the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in the soil. Thus it is important to know the impact of disturbances on the nematode population. In an effort to examine nematode density and carbon and nitrogen content in soil, we took soil samples from burned and unburned plots in the oak forest of the Conard Environmental Research Area in central Iowa. We found no significant difference in nematode density or nutrient level between the experimental and control plots. Future research should include measurements of soil moisture and identification of nematode species to better understand the impact of burning on nematode communities.
