%K 
%X  It is important to know the impact of nematodes on prairie ecosystems so they can be properly managed. Smolick (1974) estimated that root-feeding nematodes consumed as much plant material as cattle in a Colorado grassland ecosystem (as cited in Freckman and Virginia, 1989). Ingham and Detling (1984) found that in grassland ecosystems, nematode herbivory decreased plant production from 6-13% (as cited in Freckman and Virginia, 1989). A high population of root-feeding nematodes combined with other management techniques that reduce aboveground living plant material (biomass) could affect the success of prairie restoration efforts. Mow and burn treatments disturb the natural cycles of the prairie ecosystem but in the long run tend to have positive effects on tallgrass growth (Hulbert, 1988). Disturbances increase nutrient loss from ecosystems (Molles, 1999), and nematodes are highly dependent on the nutrients in soil organic matter (Freckman and Baldwin, 1990). I determined nematode abundance in burned and mowed plots in order to examine the effects of these management practices. I hypothesized that nematode populations will be greatest in untreated plots, and decrease in burned and mowed plots, with the lowest populations in plots that received both the burn and mowing treatment.
