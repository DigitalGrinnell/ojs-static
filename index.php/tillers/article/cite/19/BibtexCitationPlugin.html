This study examines the effects of Quercus macrocarpa (Burr Oak) trees on their surrounding soil. In late fall on the Burr Oak Savanna at the Conard Environmental Research Area, ten trees were studied for their effects on soil moisture, carbon content, temperature, strength, pH, and nitrogen levels. Though results were insignificant, averages indicated that soil inside the canopy has higher carbon levels, pH levels, and nitrogen content than soil outside, while soil outside has higher moisture, strength, and temperature levels than soil inside. Possible reasons for the nonsignificant difference are time of the year, individual tree species, size and age, and proximity to other trees.},
