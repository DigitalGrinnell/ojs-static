%T   Quercus macrocarpa  has no significant effect on surrounding soil in restored savannas
%K 
%X Trees can alter their surrounding soil drastically enough to create niches which favor flora that would otherwise find an area inhospitable. This study examines the effects of  Quercus macrocarpa  (Burr Oak) trees on their surrounding soil. In late fall on the Burr Oak Savanna at the Conard Environmental Research Area, ten trees were studied for their effects on soil moisture, carbon content, temperature, strength, pH, and nitrogen levels. Though results were insignificant, averages indicated that soil inside the canopy has higher carbon levels, pH levels, and nitrogen content than soil outside, while soil outside has higher moisture, strength, and temperature levels than soil inside. Possible reasons for the nonsignificant difference are time of the year, individual tree species, size and age, and proximity to other trees.
