%T  Ant mounds influence soil composition, but not vegetation
%K 
%X  Ecologists view anthills as natural disruptions that maintain heterogeneity in an ecosystem (Wagner et al. 1997). Considering that the longevity of ant mounds may range from 30- 60 years, their effects on the surrounding soil and vegetation may be substantial and sustained (Kelly 1996). These factors make ant nests important factors of many ecosystems, including the closed savanna. Our field study of ant mounds took place in the closed savanna portion of CERA, where there are a large number of visible ant mounds. We hoped to learn more about the relationship between ants and their surrounding environment by researching pH levels, soil organic matter (SOM), moisture content, and the biomass of grasses and forbs. We expected to find differences in all of these factors between anthills, points 0.5 meters away from ant mounds (offset points), and the control points.
