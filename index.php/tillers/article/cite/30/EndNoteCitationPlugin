%T  Soil pH influences the growth of  Phalaris arundinacea 
%K 
%X In an effort to discover the impact that soil characteristics have upon the growth of the wetland species  Phalaris arundinacea , we compared soil in wetland and forest regions of the Conard Environmental Research Area for pH levels, soil temperature, water percentage, total Carbon percentage and total Nitrogen percentage. We also conducted a greenhouse study to compare total biomass produced by  Phalaris arundinacea  planted in both wetland and forest soil. We found significant differences in the pH, soil moisture, and soil temperature between locations. No significance differences were found in Carbon and Nitrogen percentage. Our greenhouse study produced  Phalaris arundinacea  seedlings in both types of soils, but those growing in the wetland soil had significantly greater biomass. Since temperature and moisture were kept constant in the greenhouse, we conclude that soil pH influences the growth of  Phalaris arundinacea .
