	abstract = {Kiss-and-run fusion is a recent theory about exocytosis whereby the vesicles do not fully collapse into the membrane. We attempted to show that kiss-and-run fusion occurs at the neuromuscular junction of crayfish by comparing the release rates of two different FM dyes (FM 1-43 and FM 2-10). We predicted that if kiss-and-run fusion occurred at the crayfish neuromuscular junction, there would be a discrepancy between the rates of release of the dyes. We found that FM 1- 43 was released slower than FM 2-10, supporting the possibility that kiss-and-run fusion occurs at the crayfishneuromuscular junction.},
