The study tested the ESPS values in the crayfish extensor muscles when placed first in crayfish saline, and then again when the same muscles were introduced to a 2% and 10% solutions of ethanol in crayfish saline. The EPSPs of both exposed and normal crayfish decreased between the crayfish saline and the 2% ethanol solution in crayfish saline. However, in the chronically exposed crayfish, the EPSPs were not as greatly affected by the presence of the 10% ethanol solution as the non-exposed crayfish had less than 10% reduction of EPSP amplitude. These results indicate that crayfish with chronic exposure to ethanol may process it and react differently react to the presence of ethanol than normal crayfish.},
