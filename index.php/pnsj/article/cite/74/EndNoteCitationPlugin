%X SNARE proteins play an essential role in neurotransmission. Impaired SNARE function inhibits neurotransmission by blocking exocytic membrane fusion. Using intracellular microelectrodes, we measured the amplitude of the EPSP in the superficial exterior muscles of a crayfish in saline solution in the presence of a 6-mer peptide Argireline, a drug which researchers claim prevents the formation of the SNARE complex and therefore inhibits neuroexocytic transmission, and in the presence of a control solution containing Hyauronic acid. The results from this experiment were inconclusive.
