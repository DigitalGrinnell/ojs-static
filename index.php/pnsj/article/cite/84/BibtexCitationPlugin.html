	abstract = {The classical mode of neurotransmitter release, full collapse fusion (FCF), occurs when a vesicle is completely incorporated into the presynaptic membrane. Growing evidence supports a novel additional mode of neurotransmitter release known as \&quot;kiss-and-run\&quot; (K&amp;R) in which the vesicle transiently fuses with the membrane, maintaining its basic morphology. In this study we sought to determine whether K&amp;R occurs at the crayfish neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and, if it does exist, whether its prevalence is dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration. We loaded the dye FM1-43 and the fluorescence quencher bromophenol blue (BPB) into synaptic vesicles and looked for a fluorescence increase corresponding to the segregation of FM1-43 from BPB through K&amp;R. We observed K&amp;R at a low extracellular calcium concentration, but it was ambiguous whether K&amp;R occurred at normal extracellular calcium levels. Thus, extracellular calcium appears to play a role in determining the mode of neurotransmitter release.},
