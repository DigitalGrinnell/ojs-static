N2  -  Nitric oxide has been shown to play a role in neurotransmitter release, and consequently, a role in long-term potentiation. However, its role in synaptic plasticity at the neuromuscular junction is debated. The effects of inhibiting nitric oxide production on long-term potentiation in the crayfish tail extensor muscle was studied. As previous research suggests that NO may play an important role in neurotransmitter release, we hypothesized that its presence is necessary for long-term potentiation at the neuromuscular junction. Crayfish tail extensor muscles were stimulated at a high frequency and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded in both a baseline saline solution and a solution containing the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME. Though our results showed the EPSP percent change of the post-tetanic stimulation LTP to be consistently less than that of the baseline recordings, the results were statistically insignificant. Further research into the role of NO on synaptic plasticity is prompted.
