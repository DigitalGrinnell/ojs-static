N2  -  This experiment tested the effects of fluoxetine (Prozac) after the addition of serotonin to the saline solution on the EPSP amplitudes of crayfish muscle cells. We tested this using a sharp glass microelectrode as a recording electrode and a filed glass microelectrode as a suction electrode used to draw up nerves to be stimulated. We compared the recorded EPSP amplitudes from crayfish muscle cells exposed fluoxetine and serotonin to the initial control, with no drug, and the experimental control, with just serotonin in the saline solution. We found that serotonin alone amplifies the EPSP amplitude, however the addition of fluoxetine, had no significant effects.
