	abstract = {5-HT is known to increase the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the crayfish neuromuscular junction, but it is not known how 5-HT does this. It is possible that 5-HT acts through IP3-induced intracellular Ca2+ release. To test this, we bathed a crayfish neuromuscular junction in a solution of 5-HT plus the IP3 inhibitor 2-APB and measured EPSP amplitudes. We compared these with EPSP measurements taken in a solution with 5-HT alone. We found that the application of the IP3 inhibitor counteracts the amplitude-increasing effect of 5-HT. This supports our hypothesis that 5-HT works through IP3-induced Ca2+ increase to increase the amplitudes of EPSPs in the crayfish neuromuscular junction.},
