%T  Identifying CB 1  Receptors in the crayfish neuromuscular junction through immunofluorescence staining
%K 
%X Cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 ) are present on presynaptic nerve terminals and alter release of neurotransmitters. Previous research asserts that CB 1  receptors are expressed in the majority of the animal kingdom, yet its presence in invertebrates have led to contradictory evidence supporting and disproving its existence (McPartland et al. 2006). Earlier, a study has found CB 1  receptors in the lizard nerve terminal (Newman et al. 2007). Our goal is to further this discussion by identifying whether CB 1  receptors are present in the crayfish extensor muscle’s presynaptic terminals. Our research design centers around the application of immunofluorescence staining through the use of two different antibodies that will result in two different stains (one for CB 1  receptors and the other for the presynaptic terminal). Our major results were the colocalization of anti-SNAP-25 and CB 1 . This colocalization suggests that CB 1  receptors, first of all, do exist in the crayfish neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where endocannabinoids may play a functional role.
