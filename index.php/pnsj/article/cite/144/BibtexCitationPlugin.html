We supposed that substitution of manganese, another divalent cation, in extracellular crayfish saline would cause the frequency of the spontaneous APs to decrease and the duration of the APs to increase. Our results indicate that the duration of APs was increased due to extracellular replacement of calcium with magnesium and, contrary to what we originally postulated, we also obtained data showing that the frequency of APs increased as well. We believe this latter result may have been because the calcium charge shielding effect was lost at the synapse, thereby decreasing AP threshold.},
