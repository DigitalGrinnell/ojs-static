	abstract = {Trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentane dicarboxylic acid (trans-ACPD) is an agonist at metabotropic glutamate receptors. We demonstrate that extracellular application of trans-ACPD inhibits excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) over a period of several seconds at the neuromuscular junction in the superficial extensor muscle of the crayfish. This inhibition appears to be reversible and is possibly related to a change in the presynaptic cellular machinery.},
