N2  -  It is my pleasure to present the eighteenth volume of  Pioneering Neuroscience: The Grinnell Journal of Neurophysiology . The articles collected in this volume represent original contributions to the field of neuroscience offered by students  in the seventeenth  offering of Biology 150: Introduction to Biological Inquiry - the Language of Neurons. As has been true for sixteen previous classes of Bio 150 (one of the volumes was created by students in an advanced class), this course was taken by most of the students during their first semester in college. For all of the students, this was their first college-level biology course!     I wish to thank the students of Biology 150 for their hard work and collegiality. None of this would have been possible without the contributions of  Ashley Wolterstorff , the lab instructor, and the excellent work of mentor/lab assistant  Emily Kozik ’19 . The cover art was created by  Aubrie Torhorst ’23 . Other artwork credits include:  Hyejun Jung ’23  (p. 6) and  Nate L’esperance ’23  (p. 20). Last, but not least, I wish to recognize  Dr. Steve Ryan  for creating and  Jamie Lee ’23  for naming the wonderful SLURP (Simultaneous Liquid Uptake and Replacement Pump).
