%T  Spermidine may alter EPSP amplitude at the crayfish neuromuscular junction
%K 
%X  Spermidine is a protein that is known to enhance NMDA receptor function but seems to depress EPSP amplitudes. Our experiment tested the effects of spermidine on EPSP amplitudes at neuromuscular junctions in crayfish. The EPSP amplitudes were measured with intracellular electrodes exposed to a control saline solution and a 100?M spermidine solution. Our results were varied as spermidine increased EPSP amplitudes in some trials and decreased EPSP amplitudes in others. While it’s unclear how spermidine affects EPSP amplitude it’s clear that it changes the post-synaptic cell activity in the neuromuscular junction of crayfish.
