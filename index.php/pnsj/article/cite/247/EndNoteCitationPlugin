%T  Role of group 1 metabotropic glutamate antagonists in facilitation of post-tetanic plasticity is unclear in crayfish neuromuscular junction
%K 
%X  Previous research suggests that glutamate receptors play a role in drug-seeking behaviors. To observe the effect of glutamate receptors, we were looking for the relationship between group I glutamate receptors and postsynaptic plasticity. We had predicted that an increase in the concentration of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist SIB 1757 would decrease depression in the crayfish neuromuscular junction. We applied the antagonist in concentrations of .4 ?M and 4 ?M, and stimulated nerves in the crayfish tail at 20 Hz for 10 seconds each. Depression or potentiation occurred depending on the nerve that was stimulated. No connection between antagonist and post-tetanic plasticity was observed.
