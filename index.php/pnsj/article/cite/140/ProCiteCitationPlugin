N2  -  We varied the concentration of CO in the crayfish neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to observe the effects of CO on excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) and post-tetanic facilitation and depression. The decrease of CO in the crayfish NMJ had significant effects on post-tetanic EPSP amplitudes. Additionally, decreased CO increased post-tetanic facilitation immediately following stimulation, while increased levels of CO did not significantly affect post-tetanic facilitation except when combined with an NOS inhibitor. While we did not observe PTP as expected, we observed posttetanic facilitation and depression in the crayfish NMJ.
