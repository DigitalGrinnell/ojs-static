	abstract = {The retrograde messenger, nitric oxide, has been shown to modulate the release of acetylcholine in the presence of Ca at the frog neuromuscular junction (nmj). NO and Ca are also thought to regulate synaptic plasticity. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, has been shown to downregulate the production of endogenous NO. In this study we tested for facilitation at the frog nmj in the presence and absence of L-NAME. We found that L-NAME prolonged higher levels of synaptic facilitation in paired pulse stimulations at low frequency (0.2 Hz).},
