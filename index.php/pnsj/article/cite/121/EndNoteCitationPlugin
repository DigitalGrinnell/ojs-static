%T  M 2  receptor mediates a decrease in ACh release at the frog neuromuscular junction
%K 
%X Muscarinic receptors have been implicated in modulating ACh release at vertebrate neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). We characterized the roles of M 2  and M 3  receptors at the frog NMJ by pharmacologically isolating each receptor and measuring ACh release in terms of EPP amplitude. We observed an M 2  mediated inhibition of ACh release and no apparent involvement of M 3  receptors. We conclude that muscarinic responses in the frog are unlike those observed in the lizard or the rat.
