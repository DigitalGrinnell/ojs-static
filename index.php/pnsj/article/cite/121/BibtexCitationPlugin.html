	abstract = {Muscarinic receptors have been implicated in modulating ACh release at vertebrate neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). We characterized the roles of M2 and M3 receptors at the frog NMJ by pharmacologically isolating each receptor and measuring ACh release in terms of EPP amplitude. We observed an M2 mediated inhibition of ACh release and no apparent involvement of M3 receptors. We conclude that muscarinic responses in the frog are unlike those observed in the lizard or the rat.},
