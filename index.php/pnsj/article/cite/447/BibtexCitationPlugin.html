	abstract = {We examined how homocysteine increases oxidative stress in the crayfish neuromuscular junction, and if hydrogen sulfide is able to reverse these changes. We hypothesized that hydrogen sulfide would reduce the negative effect of homocysteine on the crayfish neuromuscular junction by decreasing the overall oxidative stress. This experiment was conducted by using intracellular recording and paired-pulse stimulation in order to test the synaptic response of the crayfish after incubating the crayfish tail in the Ringerâ€™s solution, homocysteine, or hydrogen sulfide with homocysteine for two hours. We found that hydrogen sulfide reduced the negative effects of homocysteine, causing the presynaptic response to be similar to that of the control experiment.},
