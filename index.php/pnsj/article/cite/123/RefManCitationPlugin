N2  - In the course of our experiment, we exposed the glutamatergic synapses of crayfish to 44 mM and 88 mM ethanol and obtained excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP) readings. These readings were compared to baseline EPSP readings which were taken before the ethanol was added. It was expected that the amplitudes of the EPSP's would decrease after the addition of ethanol, resulting in decreased synaptic transmission. The experiment revealed that when 44 mM ethanol was introduced to the synapses of crayfish, the EPSP amplitude did in fact decrease, but the 88 mM solution saw the amplitude initially drop and then increase.
