%T  Serotonin Enhances EPSP Amplitudes via the Release of Calcium Stores at IP 3  Receptor Sites and 2-APB Inhibits these Receptors and Decreases EPSP Amplitudes at the Crayfish Neuromuscular Junction
%K 
%X Serotonin induces the release of internal calcium stores in the superficial extensor muscle of the crayfish neuromuscular junction. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ) and ryanodine receptor sites have both been implicated as the principal receptor for internal calcium. This study attempted to isolate and interpret the activity at IP 3  receptor sites by enhancing calcium release with serotonin (5-HT) and then inhibiting IP 3  receptors with the chemical 2- Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). We predicted that 5-HT would enhance excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitudes and the addition of 2-APB would mitigate this effect. This would imply that IP 3  receptors are the principal internal calcium receptors when the cell is exposed to 5-HT. Results were significant, mostly supporting our hypothesis. The data indicate that IP 3  receptors are the principal site of serotonin-induced calcium release but other sites and mechanisms are most likely also involved in this process. There is a need for variation in methods and approaches in this type of research to better understand the role of IP 3  receptors in the release of internal calcium stores.
