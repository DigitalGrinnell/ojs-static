TI  -  Long term depression decreased in crayfish chronically exposed to Fluoxetine

N2  - Research is limited on the effects of Fluoxetine on living organisms. Due to that fact, we studied the effects of Fluoxetine, a specific SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), on crayfish superficial extensor muscles. In this study, excitatory junction potential (EJP) amplitudes were measured using intracellular recording on two different groups of crayfish – one with acute exposure to fluoxetine and another with chronic exposure. We found that although acute fluoxetine exposure did not affect long-term depression (LTD), chronic exposure to the drug reduced LTD.
