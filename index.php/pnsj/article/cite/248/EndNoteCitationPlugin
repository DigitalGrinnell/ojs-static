%T  Ketamine reduces EPSP amplitude and increases paired-pulse facilitation in  Procambarus clarkii ’s neuromuscular junction
%K 
%X  Ketamine is recently found to have effects on humans’ synaptic plasticity that are similar effect antidepressant. Studying this drug’s effect on invertebrate’s synaptic plasticity can shed light into its influence on humans. Our research focused on ketamine’s role in the synaptic plasticity of crayfish dorsal extensor’s muscular junction. Specifically, we examined how ketamine affects the excitatory postsynaptic response in  Procambarus clarkii . In our experiment, we applied paired-pulse stimulation on crayfish tail in 3 conditions: basic crayfish saline (control), ketamine solution (250?M and 500?M), and return to control. We examined the EPSP amplitudes and the percent change between all conditions. Our findings revealed that there was a reduction in synaptic excitation when ketamine was introduced but there was increase in facilitation of the second EPSP pulse. The difference between the two concentrations of ketamine, however, were not dramatic, revealing that 250?M of the drug may have been sufficient in blocking the receptors. We also deduced from our “return to control” data that ketamine did have a long lasting effect on the neuromuscular junction.
