%T  Perisynaptic Schwann Cells are Located Close to Nerve Cells in Crayfish Tail Extensor Muscles
%K 
%X The objective of our study was to locate perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs) in the crayfish neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Using fluorescent staining technique/microscopy, we were able to affirm our hypothesis that PSCs are located adjacent to nerve cells in the crayfish NMJ. Staining of nerve cells with 4-Di-2-Asp and PSCs with Syto-61 indicated that neurons and PSCs are, in fact, located in close proximity to one another in the crayfish tail extensor muscles. Knowing the spatial relationship between neurons and glial cells can provide insight into the functions of glial cells in the crayfish peripheral nervous system (PNS). The fact that neurons and PSCs are located in close proximity to one another in the crayfish NMJ preparation suggests that PSCs may be involved in communication and modulation at crayfish PNS synapses.
