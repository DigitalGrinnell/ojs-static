N2  - We investigated the role of group II and III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in short-term synaptic plasticity at the crayfish neuromuscular junction by applying the agonist NAAG (N-acetylaspartylglutamate) and antagonist LY-341,495. NAAG is an endogenous neurotransmitter derived from glutamate and an agonist of group II and III (mainly group II) mGluRs. Past studies have investigated the role of NAAG and mGluRs in long-term synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release. Group II and III mGluRs are known to decrease synaptic plasticity when stimulated. The goal of this study was to extend that research to short-term synaptic plasticity, particularly paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). To determine whether LY-341,495 and NAAG affected PPF, we induced PPF in crayfish (Orconectes sp.) tails while soaked in a solution of control, LY-341,495, NAAG, or LY-341,495 + NAAG saline. We measured PPF with a ratio comparing the amplitude of the second EPSP to that of the first. While the LY-341,495 + NAAG solution significantly increased PPF and the LY-341,495 solution marginally increased PPF, NAAG alone did not affect PPF.
