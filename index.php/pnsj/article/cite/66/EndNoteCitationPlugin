%T  The Effects of Octopamine on the EPSPs of  Procambarus clarkii  are linked to IP 3  Receptors
%K 
%X The neurotransmitter octopamine raises the amplitude of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP) in crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ). Previous studies have ruled out a connection between octopamine’s effects and cAMP or cGMP systems, suggesting another secondary messenger system is responsible for the increase in EPSP amplitude. The IP 3  system, which is responsible for the release of intracellular calcium, has been suggested as a possible mechanism by which octopamine’s effects on EPSP are generated. Using intracellular recording, the EPSPs of crayfish in three different solutions were measured; a baseline ringer’s solution, a solution containing octopamine, and a solution containing octopamine and 2APB, an IP 3  receptor blocker. We found that the solution with the IP 3  receptor blocker had a much lower EPSP, supporting our hypothesis that octopamine acts via the IP 3  system.
