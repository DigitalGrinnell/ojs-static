N2  -  This study examined the effects of antioxidants Coenzyme Q10 and Glutathione at the neuromuscular junction of crayfish. We hypothesized that a solution containing both Coenzyme Q10 and Glutathione would show higher EJPs then each of the antioxidants independently. Microelectrodes were inserted into the superficial extensor muscles of a crayfish tail to record the excitatory junction potential (EJP) of crayfish exposed to three different combinations of antioxidants in response to a neurodegenerative substance (hydrogen peroxide). We found that there was no significant additive effect when Coenzyme Q10 and Glutathione are applied together on preventing neuromuscular degeneration
