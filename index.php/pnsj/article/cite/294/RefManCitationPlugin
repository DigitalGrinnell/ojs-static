N2  - Wrinkles are an inevitable aspect of the aging process and an entire industry has developed to combat this sign of old age. The toxic nature of BOTOX has left researchers to develop bio-safe alternatives, such as Argireline. The effects of Argireline are produced through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release by preventing the formation of the SNARE complex in the presynaptic cell. Because Argireline functions by disrupting the formation of this mechanism, we tested its effect on synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity, as well as its effect over time. By measuring EPSP amplitude and paired-pulse facilitation under increasing concentrations and over time, we can better understand the SNARE protein’s role in these properties of cell communication. Our results show an observable decrease in EPSP amplitude and an observable increase in PPF, both in increasing concentrations for Argireline. In addition, we found a significant decrease in EPSP amplitudes over time, but no significant change in PPF over time.
