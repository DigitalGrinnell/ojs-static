%T  The Behavioral and Resting Membrane Potential Responses to Acute and Chronic Ethanol Exposure
%K 
%X The effects of EtOH on the crayfish  Procambarus clarkii  were examined behaviorally in vivo and electrophysiologically in vitro. Acute and chronic effects of EtOH exposure were monitored over a 14-day period. We verified the behavioral tolerance response as a result of chronic exposure, as well as a physiological correlate through measurements of resting membrane potential. We found significant effects (p = 0.0001)  of acute and chronic EtOH exposure on the resting membrane potential. Initial acute exposure showed a drop in membrane potential (accounted for as the efflux of potassium). Chronic exposure resulted in a return to control resting membrane potential suggesting an effect on either the influx of calcium or sodium. Further research is needed to resolve this.
