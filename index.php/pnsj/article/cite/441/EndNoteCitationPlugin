%T  No evidence of homocysteine or hydrogen peroxide influence at the crayfish neuromuscular junction
%K 
%X  Due to the differences between crayfish and mammals, we researched how&nbsp;homocysteine (HCY) and hydrogen peroxide&nbsp;(H 2 O 2 ) affect the crayfish neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We hypothesized that H 2 O 2  would decrease synaptic activity at the crayfish NMJ, while HCY would enhance this inhibitory effect. We used electrophysiology to examine how the NMJ was influenced by HCY and H 2 O 2 . We concluded that there is no evidence of HCY or H 2 O 2  influence on synaptic activity at the crayfish NMJ.
