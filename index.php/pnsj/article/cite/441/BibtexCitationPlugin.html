	abstract = {Due to the differences between crayfish and mammals, we researched how homocysteine (HCY) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) affect the crayfish neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We hypothesized that H2O2 would decrease synaptic activity at the crayfish NMJ, while HCY would enhance this inhibitory effect. We used electrophysiology to examine how the NMJ was influenced by HCY and H2O2. We concluded that there is no evidence of HCY or H2O2 influence on synaptic activity at the crayfish NMJ.},
