TI  -  P/Q-type Calcium Channels Contribute to the Release of Neurotransmitters when N-type Calcium Channels are Inhibited in the Crayfish Neuromuscular Junction
JF  - Pioneering Neuroscience; Vol 6 (2005)

N2  - Neurotransmitter release is caused by an influx of calcium through voltage gated calcium channels in the presynaptic terminal. To learn more about voltage gated calcium channels, we applied Omega-Conotoxin GVIA solution to the crayfish neuromuscular junction. With this toxin, we were able to block one type of voltage-dependant calcium channel, the N-type calcium channel. We predicted that the excitatory post synaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude would decrease, but not disappear completely, because of the compensation of calcium ion influx by the P/Q-type calcium channels. We found that the EPSP amplitude decreased significantly, recovered slightly, and then gradually decreased again following the application of Omega-Conotoxin GVIA solution.
