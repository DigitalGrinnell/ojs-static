%T  Possible Selves: How Self-Perception of the Future Applies to Older Adults
%K 
%X               Possible selves research suggests that goals and perceptions of the future shape human development and behavior (Cross &amp; Markus, 1991). Although previous research demonstrates age-related differences in possible selves across time, older adults are not often included in possible selves discourse (Ryff, 1991). To better understand the diversity   of possible selves across age, we conducted an interview with 13 older adults at the Mayflower retirement community   in Grinnell, Iowa. Through our retrospective study, participants were asked to report the number and type of goals across their lifetime, satisfaction at different points in life, and concerns about health and social life domains over   time. Results indicate that older adults recalled more specific and less global goals at old age as compared to young age. Further, participants recalled more global and less specific goals in young adulthood. Our findings support the theo  ry that older adults use goal accommodation to achieve a closer fit between their ideal and actual selves (Ryff, 1991).
