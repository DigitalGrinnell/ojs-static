%X               This collection of poems explores the themes of family and memory, interrogating some of the most emo- tional pockets of one’s life by threading words into images. The collection intentionally telescopes in and out of marriage, childhood and death to give readers a sense of the transience and fragility of a life. The poems   aim to capture the eeting quality of time, and burden the reader with a sense that we don’t have very long   to live—and therefore, we must live with all the gumption, the hunger, the awareness we can muster.
